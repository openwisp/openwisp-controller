    Due to HTML's limitation in supporting nested forms, we employ a
    workaround for activating and deactivating device operations within
    the change form.

    We utilize a distinct form element (id="act_deact_device")
    specifically for these actions. The form attribute of the submit buttons (Acivate/Deactivate)
    within the submit-row div references this form. By doing so, we ensure that
    these actions can be submitted independently without causing any
    disruption to the device form.
