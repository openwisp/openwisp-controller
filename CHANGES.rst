Changelog
=========

Version 0.9.0 [unreleased]
--------------------------

WIP

Changes
~~~~~~~

- **Backward incompatible**: The default behaviour for the resolution of conflicting management
  IPs between devices of different organizations has been changed. By default, in this new version,
  the system assumes it's using only 1 management tunnel for all the organizations, so different devices
  from any organization will not have the same management IP to avoid conflicts.
  The old behavior can be restored by setting
  `OPENWISP_CONTROLLER_SHARED_MANAGEMENT_IP_ADDRESS_SPACE
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller#openwisp_controller_shared_management_ip_address_space>`_
  to ``False``.

Version 0.8.3 [2020-12-18]
--------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Increased minimum `openwisp-users version to ~=0.5.1
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-users/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#version-051-2020-12-13>`_,
  which fixes an `issue in the production setup <https://github.com/openwisp/ansible-openwisp2/issues/233>`_

Version 0.8.2 [2020-12-11]
--------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed the `bug <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/issues/334>`_
  that prevented users from adding/editing access credentials.

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Increased `django-x509 <https://github.com/openwisp/django-x509#django-x509>`_
  version to 0.9.2
- Increased `django-flat-json-widget <https://github.com/openwisp/django-flat-json-widget#django-flat-json-widget>`_
  version to 0.1.2
- Changed the `preview` button colors for better readability
- Added *help text* for *device name* field

Version 0.8.1 [2020-12-02]
--------------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

Version 0.8.0 [2020-11-23]
--------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added possibility to `extend openwisp-controller
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller#extending-openwisp-controller>`_
- Added flat JSON widget for configuration variables
- Added JSON Schema widget to credentials admin
- Added ``device_registered`` signal
- Added `OpenWISP Notifications <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-notifications#openwisp-notifications>`_
  module as a dependency, which brings support for
  web and email notifications for important events
- Allow using a different device model in update_config:
  his allows `OpenWISP Monitoring <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring#openwisp-monitoring>`_
  to override the ``can_be_updated`` method to take into account the monitoring status,
  so that push updates won't be attempted
- Added notifications for changes of ``is_working`` status of credentials
- UX, automatically add/remove default values to device context:
  automatically add or remove default values of templates to the configuration context
  (a.k.a. configuration variables) when templates are added or removed from devices
- UX: added `system defined variables
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller#system-defined-variables>`_ section

Changes
~~~~~~~

- **Backward incompatible**: the code of `django-netjsonconfig <https://github.com/openwisp/django-netjsonconfig>`_
  was merged in openwisp-controller to simplify maintenance
- Changed API of ``device_location`` view for consistency: ``/api/device-location/{id}/``
  becomes ``/api/v1/device/{id}/location/``, the old URL is kept for backward compatibility
  but will be removed in the future
- **Backward incompatible change**: schema url endpoint changed to ``<controller-url>/config/schema.json``
  and it's now in config namespace instead of admin namespace
- Changed VPN DH length to 2048 and move its generation to the background because it's a lot slower
- Admin: Order Device, Template and VPN alphabetically by default
- Admin: Added ``mac_address`` field to the device list page (``DeviceAdmin.list_display``)
- Increased ``max_length`` of common name to ``64``
- Changed the config apply logic to avoid restarting the openwisp-config
  deamon if the configuration apply procedure is already being run
- Made template ``config`` field required in most cases
- Changed ``DeviceConnection.failure_reason`` field to ``TextField``,
  this avoids possible exception if ``failed_reason`` is very long,
  which may happen in some corner cases
- Made Device ``verbose_name`` configurable, see ``OPENWISP_CONTROLLER_DEVICE_VERBOSE_NAME``
- Increased `netjsonconfig <https://github.com/openwisp/netjsonconfig#netjsonconfig>`__ version to 0.9.x
  (which brings support for new interface types,
  `see the change log of netjsonconfig <http://netjsonconfig.openwisp.org/en/latest/general/changelog.html#version-0-9-0-2020-11-18>`_
  for more information)
- Increased `django-x509 <https://github.com/openwisp/django-x509#django-x509>`_ version to 0.9.x
- Increased `django-loci <https://github.com/openwisp/django-loci#django-loci>`_ version to 0.4.x
  (which brings many bug fixes to the mapping feature, as long as support for
  geo-coding and reverse geo-coding,
  `see the change log of django-loci <https://github.com/openwisp/django-loci/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#version-040-2020-11-19>`_
  for more information)
- Increased `openwisp-users <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-users#openwisp-users>`__ version from 0.2.x to 0.5.x
  (which brings many interesting improvements to multi-tenancy,
  `see the change log of openwisp-users <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-users/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#version-050-2020-11-18>`_
  for more information)
- Increased `django-taggit <https://github.com/jazzband/django-taggit>`_ version to 1.3.x
- Increased `openwisp-utils <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-utils#openwisp-utils>`__ version to 0.7.x
- Increased `django-rest-framework-gis <https://github.com/openwisp/django-rest-framework-gis>`_ version to 0.16.x
- Added support for django 3.1

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed JSON validation error when dealing with OpenVPN configuration
- Ensured ``unique`` in ``HARDWARE_ID_OPTIONS`` defaults to ``False``
- Avoid need of migration if ``HARDWARE_ID_OPTIONS`` is changed
- JS: prevent crash if backend value is empty
- Do not execute default template selection if device exists
- Close preview overlay on errors
- Avoid triggering ``config_modified`` signal during registration
- UI: Fixed whitespace after overview tab in in device page
- Validate ``Config.context`` and ``Template.default_values``:
  ``Config.context`` and ``Template.default_values`` must always be a dictionary,
  falsy values will be converted to empty dictionary automatically
- Fixed failures in ``update_config`` operation:
  the ``update_config`` operation will be executed only when the transaction
  is committed to the database; also handled rare but possible error conditions
- Handled device not existing case in ``update_config`` task
- Fixed auto cert feature failure when device name is too long
- UI: avoid showing main scrollbar in preview mode
- Fixed ``OPENWISP_CONTROLLER_BACKEND_DEVICE_LIST = False``
- UI fixed advanced mode bugs: positioning is done using css instead of js.
  Removed body scrollbar when in advanced mode.
  Back to normal mode with ESC key.
  Hidden netjsonconfig docs hint on narrow screens.
- Avoid simultaneous ``update_config`` tasks:
  since now the launch of the task is executed when the
  transaction is committed to the database, also the
  check for other updates in progress must be moved there
- Fixed ``OPENWISP_CONTROLLER_CONTEXT`` setting getting modified at run time
- Fixed z-index of preview overlay: the z-index is increased so it's higher
  than the main navigation menu to avoid the possibility of triggering the
  main menu inadvertently
- Prevent sending ``config_modified`` signal multiple times
- Fix timeout when changing template: slow operations are moved to the background
- Fixed variablle validation: now all the available context
  (device variables, system variables) are taken into account when performing validation
- Removed unnecessary ``static()`` call from media assets
