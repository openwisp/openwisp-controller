Changes
~~~~~~~

Backward incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Since django-sortedm2m, the widget we use to implement ordered templates,
  clears all the many to many relationships every time it has to make changes,
  we had to stop deleting ``VpnClient`` instances related to VPN templates
  on ``post_clear`` m2m signals
  If you wrote any custom derivative which relies on calls like
  ``device.config.templates.clear()`` to delete related ``VpnClient``
  instances and their x509 certificates, you will have to update your code
  to remove all the templates using their primary keys,
  instead of using ``clear()``
- The default behavior for the resolution of conflicting management
  IPs between devices of different organizations has been changed;
  by default, in this new version, the system assumes it's using only
  1 management tunnel for all the organizations, so different devices
  from any organization will not have the same management IP to avoid
  conflicts. The old behaviour can be restored by setting
  `OPENWISP_CONTROLLER_SHARED_MANAGEMENT_IP_ADDRESS_SPACE
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller#openwisp_controller_shared_management_ip_address_space>`_
  to ``False``
- ``OPENWISP_CONTROLLER_BACKEND_DEVICE_LIST`` has been renamed
  to ``OPENWISP_CONTROLLER_CONFIG_BACKEND_FIELD_SHOWN``
- ``Device.check_management_ip_changed`` has been changed to private API
  ``Device._check_management_ip_changed``

Other changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `Reworked implementation of config_modified signal
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller#config_modified>`_:

  - the signal is now always emitted on templates changes m2m events,
    also if ``config.status`` is modified, with the differences that
    only post_add and post_remove m2m events are used, while
    ``post_clear`` is ignored, which fixes the duplicate signal emission
    caused by the implementation of sortedm2m;
  - added ``action`` and ``previous_status`` arguments, which allow to
    understand where the ``config_modified`` signal is being emitted from,
    this allows more advanced usage of the signal by custom implementations

- Context variable follows template order:
  If two or more applied templates have "default_values" with the same keys,
  then the context variables of the template which comes later in the order
  will be used
- New credentials created with ``auto_add`` set to ``True`` will get added
  to the existing devices in a background task. This improves the
  responsiveness of the web application
- Decoupled admin LogEntry from Template model
- Device admin only lists relevant templates, i.e.
  templates that are shared or belong to the device's organization
- Improved UX of `system-defined variables
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/issues/344>`_
- Name of ``Vpn``, ``Template`` and ``Credentials`` objects is
  unique only within the same organization and within the shared
  objects
- Added functionality to configure connection failure reasons
  for which the system should not send notifications.
  Added ``old_failure_reason`` parameter in
  ``openwisp_controller.connection.signals.is_working_changed`` signal
- Allowed searching devices using their location address in Device admin.
- Removed deprecated ``api/device-location/<pk>`` endpoint
- Made device name unique per organization instead of unique system wide
- Added time limits to background celery tasks

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug which caused ``VpnClient`` instances to be recreated every time
  the configuration templates of a device were changed,
  which caused x590 certificates to be destroyed and recreated as well
- Hardened config validation of OpenVPN backend. The validation fails
  if the ``openvpn`` key is missing from the configuration
- Fixed a bug that caused issues in updating related ``Config`` whenever
  a template's ``default_values`` were changed
- Fixed pop-up view of CA and Cert not displaying data
- Fixed config status stays ``applied`` after clearing all device templates
- Fixed ``VpnClient`` not created when multiple VPN templates are added

  fields with ``maxLength`` set
- Fixed connection notifications reporting outdated status

  broke OpenWISP's extensibility
- Fixed bugs in restoring deleted devices using ``django-reversion``
- Fixed cloning of shared templates
- Disallowed blank values for ``key_length`` or ``digest`` fields for ``CA``
  and ``Cert`` objects
- Fixed template ordering bug in the configuration preview on Device admin
  The order of templates was not always retained when
  generating the preview of a config object

  that raised ``UnicodeDecodeError``, improved logging and ignored unicode
  conversion issues
- Fixed `context loading from default values of templates overwriting system
  defined variables <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/issues/352>`_
  in device admin
- Fixed `default template selection not updating after changing backend field <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/issues/354>`_
  in device admin
- Fixed JSONSchema widget to enable working with a single schema
- Fixed `related configuration not getting updated after template "default_values" are changed <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/issues/352>`_
- Fixed `bug which caused the unsaved changes alert in device admin <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/issues/388>`_
  when location of device is present
- Fixed `bug replacing manually entered device information with empty string <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/issues/425>`_
- Fixed `multiple requests for fetching default template values in device admin <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/issues/423>`_

  his allows `OpenWISP Monitoring <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-monitoring#openwisp-monitoring>`_
  to override the ``can_be_updated`` method to take into account the monitoring status,
  so that push updates won't be attempted
- Added notifications for changes of ``is_working`` status of credentials

Changes
~~~~~~~

- **Backward incompatible**: the code of `django-netjsonconfig <https://github.com/openwisp/django-netjsonconfig>`_
  was merged in openwisp-controller to simplify maintenance
- Changed API of ``device_location`` view for consistency: ``/api/device-location/{id}/``
  becomes ``/api/v1/device/{id}/location/``, the old URL is kept for backward compatibility
  but will be removed in the future
- **Backward incompatible change**: schema url endpoint changed to ``<controller-url>/config/schema.json``
  and it's now in config namespace instead of admin namespace
- Changed VPN DH length to 2048 and move its generation to the background because it's a lot slower
- Admin: Order Device, Template and VPN alphabetically by default
- Admin: Added ``mac_address`` field to the device list page (``DeviceAdmin.list_display``)

- Changed the config apply logic to avoid restarting the openwisp-config
  deamon if the configuration apply procedure is already being run
- Made template ``config`` field required in most cases
- Changed ``DeviceConnection.failure_reason`` field to ``TextField``,
  this avoids possible exception if ``failed_reason`` is very long,
  which may happen in some corner cases
- Made Device ``verbose_name`` configurable, see ``OPENWISP_CONTROLLER_DEVICE_VERBOSE_NAME``
- Increased `netjsonconfig <https://github.com/openwisp/netjsonconfig#netjsonconfig>`__ version to 0.9.x
  (which brings support for new interface types,
  `see the change log of netjsonconfig <http://netjsonconfig.openwisp.org/en/latest/general/changelog.html#version-0-9-0-2020-11-18>`_
  for more information)
- Increased `django-x509 <https://github.com/openwisp/django-x509#django-x509>`_ version to 0.9.x
- Increased `django-loci <https://github.com/openwisp/django-loci#django-loci>`_ version to 0.4.x
  (which brings many bug fixes to the mapping feature, as long as support for
  geo-coding and reverse geo-coding,
  `see the change log of django-loci <https://github.com/openwisp/django-loci/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#version-040-2020-11-19>`_
  for more information)
- Increased `openwisp-users <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-users#openwisp-users>`__ version from 0.2.x to 0.5.x
  (which brings many interesting improvements to multi-tenancy,
  `see the change log of openwisp-users <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-users/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#version-050-2020-11-18>`_
  for more information)

- Added support for django 3.1

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Fixed JSON validation error when dealing with OpenVPN configuration

- Avoid need of migration if ``HARDWARE_ID_OPTIONS`` is changed
- JS: prevent crash if backend value is empty
- Do not execute default template selection if device exists
- Close preview overlay on errors
- Avoid triggering ``config_modified`` signal during registration
- UI: Fixed whitespace after overview tab in in device page
- Validate ``Config.context`` and ``Template.default_values``:
  ``Config.context`` and ``Template.default_values`` must always be a dictionary,
  falsy values will be converted to empty dictionary automatically
- Fixed failures in ``update_config`` operation:
  the ``update_config`` operation will be executed only when the transaction
  is committed to the database; also handled rare but possible error conditions
- Handled device not existing case in ``update_config`` task
- Fixed auto cert feature failure when device name is too long
- UI: avoid showing main scrollbar in preview mode
- Fixed ``OPENWISP_CONTROLLER_BACKEND_DEVICE_LIST = False``

  Removed body scrollbar when in advanced mode.
  Back to normal mode with ESC key.
  Hidden netjsonconfig docs hint on narrow screens.
- Avoid simultaneous ``update_config`` tasks:
  since now the launch of the task is executed when the
  transaction is committed to the database, also the
  check for other updates in progress must be moved there
- Fixed ``OPENWISP_CONTROLLER_CONTEXT`` setting getting modified at run time
- Fixed z-index of preview overlay: the z-index is increased so it's higher
  than the main navigation menu to avoid the possibility of triggering the
  main menu inadvertently
- Prevent sending ``config_modified`` signal multiple times
- Fix timeout when changing template: slow operations are moved to the background
- Fixed variablle validation: now all the available context
  (device variables, system variables) are taken into account when performing validation
- Removed unnecessary ``static()`` call from media assets
