      OpenWISP is a software platform designed to ease and automate the
      management of networks, with a special focus on wireless networks, mainly
      used in public wifi, mesh networks, community networks and IoT scenarios.

      OpenWISP 2, launched in December 2016, is the new generation of the
      software which is gradually replacing OpenWISP 1 and aims to build an
      ecosystem of applications and tools that make it easy for developers to
      build custom networking applications in order to bring innovation in the
      network infrastructure of communities that most need it.
